# Windows Phone 8.1 CLR Analysis

## Overview
This document contains research and analysis of the Windows Phone 8.1 Common Language Runtime to understand how to implement a modern CLR replacement.

## WP8.1 CLR Architecture

### Runtime Components
- **Core CLR:** Basic execution engine
- **Framework Libraries:** .NET Framework subset for mobile
- **JIT Compiler:** Just-in-time compilation for ARM
- **Garbage Collector:** Memory management
- **Type System:** Metadata and reflection support

### Key Differences from Full .NET Framework
- **Reduced API Surface:** Limited to mobile-appropriate APIs
- **ARM Architecture:** Compiled for ARM processors
- **Silverlight Base:** Built on Silverlight runtime model
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Limited system access by design
- **Compact Framework Elements:** Some CF-style limitations

### Memory Layout
```
[To be filled with reverse engineering findings]
- Process memory structure
- CLR heap organization
- Native code layout
- Metadata storage
```

### Security Model
- **Application Isolation:** Each app runs in separate container
- **Code Access Security:** Restricted API access
- **Native Interop:** Limited P/Invoke capabilities
- **File System Access:** Isolated storage only

## Reverse Engineering Notes

### Tools Used
- [ ] IDA Pro / Ghidra for binary analysis
- [ ] WinDbg for runtime debugging
- [ ] Process Monitor for file/registry access
- [ ] API Monitor for system call tracing

### Key Files to Analyze
- `mscorwks.dll` - Core CLR implementation
- `mscorlib.dll` - Base class library
- `System.*.dll` - Framework assemblies
- Native runtime components in Windows CE

### Memory Mapping
```
[To be documented through debugging]
- CLR loader address space
- JIT code cache location
- Managed heap boundaries
- Native stack organization
```

## Compatibility Analysis

### .NET Framework Compatibility
- **Target Framework:** .NET Framework 4.0/4.5 subset
- **Missing Features:** Full reflection, code generation, etc.
- **Modified Behavior:** File I/O, networking, threading
- **Security Restrictions:** CAS policies, trust levels

### Modern .NET Compatibility Gaps
- **Runtime Version:** Compare with .NET Core/.NET 5+
- **API Differences:** New APIs not available
- **Performance Improvements:** Modern JIT optimizations
- **Language Features:** C# version limitations

## Integration Points

### System Integration Opportunities
- **Process Creation:** How apps are launched
- **Assembly Loading:** Custom assembly resolver
- **JIT Hooking:** Intercept compilation
- **GC Replacement:** Memory management override

### Interop Mechanisms
- **P/Invoke:** Native code calling
- **COM Interop:** System service access
- **WinRT Integration:** Modern Windows APIs
- **Native Libraries:** Custom native components

## Research Action Items

- [ ] Dump and analyze WP8.1 CLR binaries
- [ ] Map memory layout of running .NET apps
- [ ] Identify entry points for custom runtime injection
- [ ] Document security mechanisms and bypass options
- [ ] Test existing .NET Core components on WP8.1
- [ ] Analyze WinRT bridge architecture
- [ ] Research sideloading and deployment mechanisms
