# Phase 1: Userland Runtime

## Overview
Phase 1 implements a sandboxed CLR runtime that can execute in userland without any system modifications. This provides a safe foundation for testing modern .NET code portability on Windows Phone 8.1.

## Architecture

### Sandboxed Execution Model
```
Application Directory Structure:
/Data/Users/DefApps/AppID_{GUID}/Local/
├─ runtime/              # Custom CLR implementation
│  ├─ clrnet.dll        # Core runtime
│  ├─ mscorlib.dll      # Base class library  
│  ├─ system.dll        # Extended BCL
│  └─ jit/              # JIT compiler
├─ application/         # User application
│  ├─ app.exe          # Entry point
│  └─ app.dll          # Application logic
└─ temp/               # JIT cache and temp files
```

### Runtime Components

#### Core Execution Engine (`CoreExecutionEngine`)
- Minimal CLR implementation for basic execution
- Type system and metadata handling
- Method dispatch and virtual calls
- Exception handling infrastructure

#### JIT Compiler (`SimpleJIT`) 
- Basic ARM32 code generation
- Simple optimization passes
- Method compilation on demand
- Code cache management

#### Memory Manager (`SandboxGC`)
- Simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector
- Limited to application memory space
- No system-wide memory management
- Conservative GC for safety

#### Assembly Loader (`IsolatedLoader`)
- Load assemblies from application directory only
- Basic security and verification
- Dependency resolution within sandbox
- No GAC or system assembly access

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Object allocation and lifetime
- [ ] Memory pressure handling

### Milestone 3: Extended Runtime

## Safety Measures

### Sandboxing Constraints
- All file operations restricted to app directory
- No network access in Phase 1
- No system API calls outside standard app model
- No device hardware access
- Standard WP8.1 security permissions only

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on unsupported operations
- Clear error messages for debugging
- No system corruption on failures
- Safe termination procedures

### Resource Limits
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU time limits for JIT compilation  
- File system space quotas
- Thread count restrictions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Core runtime functionality
- Memory management correctness
- JIT compiler output validation
- Assembly loading scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Sample applications end-to-end
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory leak detection
- Stress testing under constraints

### Compatibility Tests
- .NET Framework API compliance
- Existing code portability
- Language feature support
- Library compatibility validation

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Visual Studio 2015+ with ARM support
- Windows Phone 8.1 SDK  
- Device or emulator for testing
- Debugging and profiling tools

### Development Workflow
1. Implement component in C++/C#
2. Cross-compile for ARM32
3. Deploy to device/emulator
4. Test in sandboxed environment
5. Iterate based on results
