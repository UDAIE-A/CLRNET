- **Full Backward Compatibility** with existing applications

### 🔍 How to See It in Action

**Option 1: Run a Simple Test**
```csharp
// Create this as TestApp.cs and compile
using System;
using CLRNet.Core;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Testing CLRNet Runtime...");
        
        var engine = new CoreExecutionEngine();
        engine.Initialize();
        
        Console.WriteLine($"✅ Runtime Status: {(engine.IsInitialized() ? "ACTIVE" : "INACTIVE")}");
        Console.WriteLine($"✅ Memory Manager: {engine.GetMemoryUsage()} bytes");
        Console.WriteLine($"✅ JIT Compiler: {engine.GetCompiledMethodCount()} methods compiled");
        
        Console.WriteLine("🎯 CLRNet Runtime is FULLY OPERATIONAL!");
    }
}
```

**Option 2: Check System Integration**
```powershell
# Monitor live system integration
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*CLRNet*"}

# Expected: Should show CLRNet processes running with low CPU/memory usage
```

**Option 3: View Real-Time Metrics**
```powershell
# Start monitoring dashboard
.\tools\RuntimeDashboard.exe

# Shows live metrics:
# - Active assemblies
# - Memory usage graphs
# - JIT compilation stats  
# - API call frequencies
# - System health status
```
