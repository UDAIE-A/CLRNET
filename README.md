# CLRNET

**Modern .NET tooling for Windows Phone 8.1 â€” without touching the sealed Microsoft CLR.** CLRNET ships a drop-in runtime, overlay libraries, and build tooling so you can write with the latest C#, run modern libraries, and keep legacy devices productive.

---

## ðŸ“Œ TL;DR
* Ship an app-local "mini .NET" (`CLRNetOverlay/`) so your apps resolve modern APIs like `System.Text.Json`, `ValueTask`, async streams, and hardened HTTP helpers on Windows Phone 8.1.
* Execute dynamic code safely with the userspace IL virtual machine that handles `Expression.Compile`, `DynamicMethod`, and other scenarios the stock runtime blocks.
* Build with Roslyn `/langversion:latest`, automatic facade references, and a post-build rewrite pipeline that targets CLRNET-friendly APIs.
* Follow the integration playbook to package, deploy, and validate everything in minutes.

## Why CLRNET?
Windows Phone 8.1 apps are locked to an outdated CoreCLR snapshot. CLRNET swaps in a fully managed runtime stack that:
* **Unlocks modern APIs** without modifying the OS by resolving CLRNET facades before system binaries.
* **Restores runtime code generation** through a sandboxed IL VM, keeping dynamic libraries and expression trees working.
* **Brings the latest C# language features** to legacy devices by wiring Roslyn, overlay references, and IL rewriting together.
* **Preserves safety** with rollback paths, sandboxing, and app-local deployment so you can test incrementally.

If you need to keep WPâ€¯8.1 hardware in the field or ship new apps to it, CLRNET is the toolkit that makes it feel like a modern .NET target again.

## Quick Start
1. **Clone & restore tooling**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/CLRNET.git
   cd CLRNET
   ```
2. **Confirm runtime health**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\simple-check.ps1
   ```
   Expect `Runtime is FULLY OPERATIONAL!` with all phases green.
3. **Enable overlay references** in your app project by importing the repoâ€™s `Directory.Build.props` and setting:
   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <CLRNET_AddOverlayFacades>true</CLRNET_AddOverlayFacades>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```
4. **Package the overlay** by copying the prepared `examples/overlay/` payload (facades, manifests, support assemblies) into your AppX under `CLRNetOverlay/`.
5. **Build with the modern pipeline** using the Roslyn toolchain or the `ModernPipelineApp` sample as a template.
6. **Deploy to device/emulator** with your usual WPâ€¯8.1 deployment tooling.
7. **Verify on-device** by running your app and checking overlay + VM diagnostics (see below).

## Pick Your Integration Track
You can adopt the tracks independently or all together:

### ðŸŸ¢ Trackâ€¯A â€“ Ship modern APIs alongside your app
* Drop the `CLRNetOverlay/` folder beside your binaries.
* Ensure your package includes `type-forward-map.txt` so the loader knows which assembly owns each forwarded type.
* Follow the [Overlay Guide](docs/APP_LOCAL_OVERLAY_GUIDE.md) for manifest samples, WinRT storage helpers, and automation tips.

### ðŸŸ¡ Trackâ€¯B â€“ Enable runtime code generation
* Add references to the `CLRNet.Core.OverlaySupport` VM APIs or call the native exports documented in the Trackâ€¯B roadmap.
* Cache compiled bytecode under `LocalCache/VmBytecode` (built-in helpers handle hashing).
* Use the sandbox knobs (time, memory, namespace allow-list) to keep plugins constrained.

### ðŸ”µ Trackâ€¯C â€“ Compile with the latest C#
* Consume the provided `Directory.Build.props` to set `/langversion:latest` and nullable context.
* Wire the Mono.Cecil post-pass (see `tools/modern-pipeline/`) into your buildâ€™s `AfterBuild` target.
* Rely on the green/yellow/red table to decide when to lean on overlays vs. the IL VM.

---

## Packaging & Distribution
* **Bundle once, reuse everywhere.** Treat `CLRNetOverlay/` as a reusable payload checked into source control or published as a `.nupkg`. Build scripts can extract it during packaging so you donâ€™t copy files manually.
* **Documented surface area.** Keep the overlay manifest in sync with the API set you ship so the loader doesnâ€™t expose types you donâ€™t implement.
* **VM warm start.** Populate `LocalCache/VmBytecode` with precompiled bytecode if your app relies heavily on dynamic features.
* **Configuration overrides.** The `OverlayConfig` subsystem honors environment overrides and package manifests so enterprise deployments can retarget overlay paths without rebuilding the app.

---

## Developing with Modern C#
* **Repository-wide props.** Import `Directory.Build.props` to inherit Roslyn tooling, nullable analysis, and facade references.
* **Sample project.** Explore `examples/ModernCSharpPipeline/` for a reference implementation showcasing records, pattern matching, ValueTask, async streams, JSON serialization, and VM-backed expression trees.
* **IL rewrites.** The `CLRNet.ModernCSharpPipeline` tool (under `tools/modern-pipeline/`) rewrites API calls that need to route through CLRNET implementations and strips problematic attributes before packaging.
* **Fallback guidance.** Use the Trackâ€¯C feature matrix to know when to expect native support, overlay polyfills, or VM execution.

## Runtime Architecture
CLRNET is delivered in three completed phases:

| Phase | Goal | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phaseâ€¯1 â€“ Userland runtime** | Core execution engine, type system, garbage collector, assembly loader, ARM32 JIT. | âœ… Complete | `src/phase1-userland/`
| **Phaseâ€¯2 â€“ System interop** | WinRT bridge, P/Invoke, hardware access, security manager. | âœ… Complete | `src/phase2-interop/`
| **Phaseâ€¯3 â€“ System integration** | CLR replacement engine, deep system hooks, rollback system. | âœ… Complete | `src/phase3-integration/`

Each phase can operate independently so you can keep deployments in userland or opt into system-wide replacement when youâ€™re ready.

---

## Diagnostics & Verification
```powershell
# Quick health check (30 seconds)
.\scripts\simple-check.ps1

# Full regression suite
.\scripts\run-all-tests.ps1

# Inspect detailed status & phase reports
Get-Content docs\RUNTIME_STATUS.md
Get-Content docs\PHASE1-STATUS.md
```

For runtime overlays, enable verbose logging via `OverlayConfig` to confirm which assemblies are resolved from the app package versus the OS.
